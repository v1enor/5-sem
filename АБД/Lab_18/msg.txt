Take me home
Take me home, it's the one place I can rest in peace
Turn off my phone
So many messages I wish I could just delete
Questioning my existence (Existence)
Questioning my decisions (Decisions)
Burning down all the bridges (Bridges)
Dig a moat, now I'm finished
Sorry, don't want you to visit, no
No
One last pic and I'll be gone
Make it count, put the flash on
Never really felt like I belonged
So I'll be on my way and I won't be long
I'll be dead by dawn
I'll be dead by dawn
I'll be dead by dawn
I'll be dead by dawn
